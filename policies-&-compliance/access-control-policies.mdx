## Access Control Policies (APIs)

This is an Early Access Program feature. Please contact your Customer Success Manager to request access.

Access Control Policies APIs allow Dialpad Company administrators to define a customized set of Ai Contact Center settings permissions that can be granted to their Dialpad users. These customized set of permissions are called policies and are composed of a permission\_set, that determines the level of access and a target\_type and target\_id that determines the applicability of such policy (company, office, callcenter). Once a policy is created, it can then be assigned to users by referencing their ID.

Below are the currently supported permission\_set values and their area of control.
