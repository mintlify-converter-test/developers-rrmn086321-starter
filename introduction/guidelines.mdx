We want you to build the best experiences for our mutual customers in a safe, responsible manner. With that in mind, we have a few guidelines that we would like you to follow.

# Terms of Service

*   First order of business, please read our Terms of Service carefully.  
    [https://www.dialpad.com/legal/#apiToS](https://www.dialpad.com/legal/#apiToS)
    

# Customer First

*   Build apps using the _values first_ principle: Talk to your users, research and document the use cases that are valuable to customers. Focus on core business problems.
*   Focus on simplicity: While it might be tempting to add complex functionality, new apps should focus on simple problems, get customer feedback, and then add more functionality.
*   Onboarding: Provide guidance to customers during the onboarding phase through detailed documentation (How-to guides, Screenshots, GIFs, or Videos)
*   Support: Provide support to customers through multiple channels (Phone, Email, Social, Chat) in line with your SLAs

# Privacy and Security

At Dialpad, we treat our customers' data with a high level of responsibility and take utmost care to ensure that it is kept secure. We expect app developers to do the same.

*   Use data only for your app and not for any other purpose
*   Do not request data that is not needed for your app
*   Use secure storage mechanisms to safeguard customer data
*   Ensure appropriate terms of service have been agreed to with your customers before allowing access to the app
*   Observe regulations such as General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)
