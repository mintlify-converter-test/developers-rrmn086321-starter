Contact events provide details on the changes made to your contacts including contact creation, update and deletion. These events can be subscribed to the shared and local contacts of a company.

Events are sent to a webhook that you (as a company admin or developer) provide. To get started, [create a webhook](/reference/webhookscreate)
 and a [contact event subscription using our API](/reference/webhook_contact_event_subscriptioncreate)
.
