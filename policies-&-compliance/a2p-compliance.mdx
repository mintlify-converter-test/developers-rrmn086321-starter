If you are using high-volume messaging or advanced messaging such as via this API, you must register your messaging campaign with The Campaign Registry (TCR) to ensure your messages get delivered. TCR is an industry reputation authority for business messaging, and unregistered campaigns, particularly high-volume campaigns, may incur additional fees or be blocked entirely. To learn how to register your campaign, visit Dialpadâ€™s Help Center article on [Text Message Campaign Registry for Dialpad Customers](https://help.dialpad.com/hc/en-us/articles/4405455062683-Text-Message-Campaign-Registry-for-Dialpad-Customers)
.

Registration is **required** to use our SMS API.
