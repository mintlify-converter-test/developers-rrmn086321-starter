## Introduction

Authentication allows you to connect a user's Dialpad account to your internal app or a third party app. This process involves providing your app with a token that's generated by Dialpad. The token generation mechanism varies depending on whether the app is an internal app or a third party app:

*   A token can be generated by administrators on a Dialpad account if the app is internal only. Refer the [API Key Generation](/docs/api-key-generation)
     guide for details.
*   A token can be generated through [OAuth](/docs/oauth)
    . We recommend using OAuth if you are an app developer that requires users across different companies to connect Dialpad with your app.

## Using the Token

All requests are authenticated via an API key/token in the query parameter or as a bearer token in the authorization header.

**Bearer Token**  
The API key can be put in the [authorization header](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6750)
. This is the recommended approach.

```curl
--SANDBOX--
curl --request GET \
  --url 'https://sandbox.dialpad.com/api/v2/company/' \
  --header 'Accept: application/json' \
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer $accessToken'

--PRODUCTION--
curl --request GET \
  --url 'https://dialpad.com/api/v2/company/' \
  --header 'Accept: application/json' \
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer $accessToken'

```

**URL Parameters**  
The API key can also be provided in the URL parameters. While allowed, we **do not** recommend this approach because the API key is confidential, and having it in the URL can be more visible in logs.

```http
https://dialpad.com/api/v2/company?apikey=<Token>

```
