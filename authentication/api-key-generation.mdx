To create and access your API key, you need to follow the below steps. Note that only Company Admins can create API keys on Dialpad.

1.  Navigate to Admin Settings > My Company > Authentication > API Keys
2.  Select **Add Key**
3.  Name your key and set the expiration terms
4.  Select desired **Additional Scopes**
5.  Select **Save**

Note that API keys are more powerful than passwords as they allow a consumer to perform actions across all users in the company in Dialpad. Therefore, they should not be exchanged over unsecured platforms. **Do not send** us the entire API key should you have a support inquiry. Instead, send over only the last 4 characters.
