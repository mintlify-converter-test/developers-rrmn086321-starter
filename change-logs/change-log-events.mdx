title: "Change Log Events"
description: "Details about changes in the Dialpad environment via webhooks."
---
Change log events provide details about changes made to the company's Dialpad environment. Currently, change log event subscriptions subscribe to all Dialpad change logs associated with the company.

Events are sent to a webhook that you (as a company admin or developer) provide. To get started, verify your [API key contains the change log scope](/docs/api-key-generation)
 and [create a webhook using our API](/reference/webhookscreate)
. Once you have a webhook, [you can create a change log event subscription](/reference/webhook_change_log_event_subscriptioncreate)
.

# Payload

Payloads sent to your webhook will contain the following fields. If you have created your webhook with a secret, the payload will be JWT encoded.

| Field | Data Type | Description | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| date | int (unix ms UTC) | The time stamp when the change log was created. |     |
| action | string | The action taken or change implemented. | The action is represented by short human readable codes (e.g., `updated_ivr`) |
| note | string | A text description to provide context to the action. | The formatting for this property is not currently standardized and may be subject to change. |
