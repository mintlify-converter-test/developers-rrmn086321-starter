title: "SMS Events"
description: "Details on near real-time SMS messages for your company."
---
SMS events provide details on SMS messages that are sent and received for your company and its users in near real-time. These events can be subscribed to for an entire company, office, or a more granular target (such as a call center or user). Delivery status events are also available by setting the `status` field to `True` when creating a subscription.

Events are sent to a webhook that you (as a company admin or developer) provide. To get started, [create a webhook](/reference/webhookscreate)
 and an [SMS event subscription using our API](/reference/webhook_sms_event_subscriptioncreate)
.

# Payload

Payloads sent to your webhook will be JWT encoded and will contain the following fields:

> ## ðŸš§
> 
> Note: By default, SMS text content is not included in events to ensure data privacy. If you are using API keys, please create a new key and add the 'message\_content\_export' when a target is specified with an event subscription, otherwise 'message\_content\_export:all' scope is required to enable this. For OAuth apps, contact [api@dialpad.com](mailto:api@dialpad.com)
>  and request the `message_content_export, message_content_export:all` OAuth scopes.

| Field | Description | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| id  | A unique number ID automatically assigned to each message. |     |
| created\_date | Unix timestamp indicating when the message was created (and sent). |     |
| direction | SMS direction. Indicates whether a message was sent (outbound) or received (inbound). |     |
| target | This is the â€˜targetâ€™ indicating who sent or received the message.    The following fields are included:    **id:** A unique ID.  **type:** User/Department/Call Center etc.  **name:** Full name of the target.  **phone\_number:** E.164 phone number. | The target is the Dialpad user, Department or Call Center, regardless of whether the message is inbound or outbound. |
| contact | This is the external contact that sent or received the message.    The following fields are included:    **id:** A unique ID.  **name:** Full name of the contact.  **phone\_number:** E.164 phone number. | The contact represents the external party, regardless of whether the message is inbound or outbound. |
| sender\_id | The ID of the user who actually sent the message in the case where the target is a group, e.g. Office/Department/Call Center etc. | The sender\_id will be null if the target is not a group. |
| from\_number | E.164 phone number of the sender. |     |
| to\_number | A list of E.164 phone number of the receiver. |     |
| mms | Boolean indicating if the message is an MMS. |     |

MMS image URLs point to images hosted by Google. By default, MMS images will constrained to a maximum of 512 pixels wide or tall. There are [various ways to modify a URL](https://sites.google.com/site/picasaresources/google-photos-1/how-to-get-a-direct-link-to-an-image) to obtain different image sizes. For example, to obtain the image in its original resolution, append `=s0` to the URL. |
| message\_status | The delivery status of the SMS. | Will be included in all payloads if you set status=True when creating the event subscription. Otherwise only the first payload will have this field. Values: `success`, `failed`, `pending` |
| message\_delivery\_result | The final result of the SMS delivery attempt | A more fine-grained enum denoting the final status of the SMS delivery attempt.  Values:`accepted`, `invalid_destination`, `invalid_source`, `no_route`, `not_supported`, `rejected`, `rejected_spam`, `internal_error`, `time_out`  (see table below for further details) |
