## FAQ

### How to send a multiple-line text?

Multiple-line text can be achieved by using `\n` in the `text` field of the API payload (e.g. "line one \\nline two!"). Such sms could be rendered as multiples lines in the Dialpad App (if the recipient is a Dialpad user) and iOS message app, but people have reported in the past the `\n` does not work on Android. But this is out of our control because it really depends on the recipientâ€™s device to render multiple lines or not when it see `\n` in the sms. If you really want the multiple line to work, you probably can try breaking it into multiple single-line sms and send them using the sms API sequentially.
